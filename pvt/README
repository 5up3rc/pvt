This extension was developed to assist in PHP web-application security
evaluation. PVT consists of several separate modules, each of them executing
different tasks:
    - tracing functions and draw CFG
    - dump opcodes
    - dump variables
    - hook string eval's
    - watch function arguments

PVT currently tested on Linux, PHP 5.3.
