PHP Vulnerability Tracer
------------------------

1. Unpack the tarball: tar -xzf pvt-0.1.x.tgz.  Note that you do
not need to unpack the tarball inside the PHP source code tree.
PVT is compiled separately, all by itself, as stated above.

2. cd pvt-0.1.x

3. Run phpize: phpize
   (or /path/to/phpize if phpize is not in your path).

4. ./configure

5. Run: make

6. cp modules/pvt.so /to/wherever/you/want/it

7. add the following line to php.ini:
   zend_extension="/wherever/you/put/it/pvt.so"

8. Restart your webserver.


USAGE
-----

PVT consists of 6 parts, modules:
    1. functions tracer
    2. opcodes dumper
    3. variables dumper
    4. eval hooker
    5. marker search
    6. variables tracer (under development)

Each module is possible to enable/disable separately. In PHP configuration file
path to log files must be defined. For each module following files will be
created (according to numbers in modules listing):
    1. dump/*/trace-functions.txt
    2. dump/*/opcodes/*.html
    3. dump/*/dump-variables.txt
    4. dump/*/dump-evaluated.phps
    5. dump/*/catched-marker.txt
Provided directory must be writable.

It is possible to override php.ini settings through GET variable, e.g.:
?_PVT=eval_hook_all=0|eval_marker=545
